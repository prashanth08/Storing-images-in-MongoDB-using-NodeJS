Storing-images-in-MongoDB-using-NodeJS
======================================

Presented a demo where the back end of the proposed system used node.js script to store data in mongo database. Implemented the base64 method to encode the image, then stored it using mongo’s BinData type as a BSON bit array. This approach utilized 20% less space than the original binary image and also resulted in a 10x increase in server’s responsiveness.
